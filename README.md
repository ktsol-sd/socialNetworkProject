Social network project (kinda like a twitter clone) this rep is just for reference. I don't think i've added the socket io path in this version but it should work and run by running npm run dev on client and npm start on server

## Update ##
You can now test this here! http://sadonproject.xyz

A few known bugs:
* ~~SocketIO is not working properly as far as I know I'm currently trying to fix it.~~ Apparently it does work
* Search function shows users more than once if they have similar words/numbers in their names
* If you login and revisit the website later you might get 500 error and have to log out and log in again.
